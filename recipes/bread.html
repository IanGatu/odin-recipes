    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This bread recipe yields a crusty exterior with a soft and airy interior. Perfect for sandwiches or as a side to soups and stews.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups warm water (110째F/45째C)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450째F (230째C). Place a baking stone or an inverted baking sheet in the oven to heat up.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and shape it into a round loaf. Place it on a piece of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Make a few slashes on the top of the loaf with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the parchment paper with the loaf onto the preheated baking stone or sheet in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
